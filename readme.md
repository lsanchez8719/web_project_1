# Web project 1
## HTML CSS
### Project Description:

<p> Project titled "Learning how to learn" was the first frontend project I created while Studying at Practicum. The project itself  explains about the difficulties some of us face while trying to acquire a brand new skill.

<p>Reading trough the website will help you understand better the concepts explained by high level achievers who reveal to the user the different methods to acquire a new skill in a smarter way and in shorter time period .<p>

## _Sprinting trough html>_
<p>While creating the project I went through the basics of HTML. I literally "woke up" into coding with almost no experience. I learned about the importance of organizing and keeping the code clean and nesting sections semantically and how to create a modern website structure <p>

<p>Experiencing the review process at first hand, was a great thing, because every mistake I did, made me go back and check what was wrong, this process of repetition was crucial for my learning process double checking everything until everything was looking as demanded in the brief<p>

<p>Creating this project was not easy at first but the continuous practice and "diving into content" took an instant effect in my subconscious. Repeating the actions over and over embedded the different parameters needed to create the basis of any website </p>

## _CSS_
<p>This was another language that i learned and used while in this project, my self coming from a graphic artist background, I had a great experience adjusting and manipulating the different attributes and styles making the site what how it looks today through this process I learned about the endless  possibilities of CSS and how to integrate it into the code effective using the BEM method <p>


## _BEM_
<p> If you "lend an eye" for a minute you will notice a pattern used all through the structure of the code. Right from the beginning of the Course I learned how to make sure other Developers who see my code are able to understand what is going on within the code.<p>
<p>All this is done by Sticking with the BEM method,
 a simple and practical way to name "classes".
using this method was time saving because a soon as you understand how it works, you know exactly how  structure the code swiftly.<p>

## _Looking Ahead_

<p> I really enjoyed my experience so far with Practicum
 I strongly recommend taking part in this course, I took of my spare time to do research in the field of developing  education and I honestly have not come across another platform alike with such rich content.<p>

<p> At some point I would like the website to have a lead capture section, where I could get contact information of people who might be interested in taking part in the program.<p>

<p>In the near future I intend to deploy the website to a cloud server, possibly AWS or through a different service, But till then I will add more pages with different content that may provide value to others looking to achieve their own developing goals. One thing for Sure I would like to make the website responsive using CSS grid. That would be the next immediate step, then I would make it visible through different mobile devices, and finally I'd like to make it rank in the different search engines results pages. The possibilities of simple one page site are endless <p>
