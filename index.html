        <div class="two-columns__main-text" <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Whether it’s at school or university, the
          one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often Just end up drilling specific exercises
          and mindlessly memorizing information so when the exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test
          is over, that information has outlived its usefulness, and there is no guarantee that information will be
          retained. In the end, we’re really just learning how to pass our tests.</p>
          <p class="two-columns__paragraph"><span class="two-columns__span-accent">Here's the real question:</span> does
            this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material ? The academic
            consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic is knowing
            how to study, but for some reason this point is overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this ? </p>
          <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Well there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to the
            educational process to help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the
            secrets of effective learning.</p>
